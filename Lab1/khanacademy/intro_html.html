<!-- Challenge: Write a Poem -->
    <h1>Never Gonna Give You Up</h1>
    <p>
    Never gonna make you cry <br>
    Never gonna say goodbye <br>
    Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
    </p>

<!-- Challenge: You can learn text tags -->

        Nobody’s born smart. <b>We all start at 0.</b> Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And <em>Shakespeare</em> had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        <strong>This. is. learning.</strong><br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that <em>anyone, anywhere</em> can understand.<br>
        <strong>Whoever you are, wherever you are.</strong><br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        You can learn anything.
    </p>
